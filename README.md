# AWS_dating
Cloud Computing CS6065 P2 project
The project is a simple dating website(dateapp).  In this dateapp users can register and get the matching people based on their interests. User can chat and message with the interested people. They can subscribe for mail and mobile alerts about the site tips. If subscribed users will get alerts about dating tips. Chat system doesn't save chat message for security reasons and since we used pubnub who is giving realtime chat service socket help.

python Flask REST framework is used for webservices. And to deploy in Amazon eservices Tornado is implemented in p2dateapp.py and deployed in ec2.
